### Business understanding of the problem:
A dataset with information on over 400 thousand used cars was provided. I prepared the dataset, experimented with different parameters to build models, and evaluated the model using the test set.
### Findings:
I analyzed the dataset to identify that the features, including odometer, year, and fuel type, most strongly influence the target variable, car price. 
### Next steps:
The dataset contained substantial missing data, particularly in the manufacturer, condition, and title_status columns. As a result, I dropped these columns. However, lots of valuable information could be extracted.
